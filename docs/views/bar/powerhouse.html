<p>During The Brig, Joe Taylor, the “Taylor of San Francisco,” sold his wares while his study was the apartment below Jim from Folsom Street Blues <cl citekey="fsleather"></cl>). Drummer 18 has a guide to body casting that Joe Taylor wrote/produced. According to <a href="http://www.leatherati.com/2012/01/a-guest-editorial-review-by-guy-baldwinofthe-leathermans-protocol-handbooka-handbook-on-old-guard-rituals-traditio/">Guy Baldwin</a>, Joe Taylor's dungeon was also featured in Drummer – Joe is at the of biker photo, right most.</p>

<p>From a Walking Tour of South Of Market in the 1970s <cl citekey="walking"></cl>:</p>
<blockquote>Ellis Chan, July 19, 1996: “The ﬁrst place I went to was the Brig. I walked in there. I didn’t have much leather on. Didn’t have chaps at the time. I didn’t have boots at the time. I did have a jacket. But I walked in there and I was absolutely terri-ﬁed because everyone was in leather, head to toe. And I was the only one who was wearing Levis and a regular shirt. I was the only one who was not in full leather and that was a time I was terriﬁed, visually, at what I was seeing, excited at the same time—tremendously excited … Oh, I stayed, and what happened was that my fears instantly vanished. I’m not exaggerating when I say that. The conversation that people were carrying on involved opera and poodles. Funny enough, the vibe hasn’t changed all too much in my opinion – anyone can come and converse about a variety of topics."</blockquote>
