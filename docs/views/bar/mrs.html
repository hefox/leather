<p>He got into the industry via way of first being a gentlemen's clothier then a textile firm representative. He came to America and got showed the scene here by a pushy bottom, which gave him the idea:  "After returning to London, I started working on a range of leather clothing and accessories that I thought would interest Americans. I produced my very first catalog, and came up with the name "Mr. S." which captured many peopleâ€™s imagination, and soon catalog requests started coming in, followed by orders. I was very pleased indeed." He opened a factory with another leather company in England prior and sold his items at "Leather-n-Things" in the Castro before finally opening up shop in SF on June 17, 1979. The first location was on 7th Street and served as a community center. Selby eventually sold the business to focus on helping those with HIV <cl citekey="selbyhall"></cl></p>
