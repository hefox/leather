<blockquote ><p>"Ringold Alley was a major site of gay male cruising, especially after the bars closed. The original “Up Your Alley” Fair was held on Ringold in honor of that history. After the leather bars closed, men would congregate on the alley, which was right behind the Ramrod. Cars, bikes, and vans would circle the block to go up the one way street. Before the empty lots were fenced in, other people would use them to park vans, some of which were fitted out with entire playrooms complete with slings and other sex equipment as well as sound systems and refrigerators and other amenities.</p>
<p>The original Up your alley started at ringhold. At the time, Up Your Alley had a strict policy of no independent vending or craft booths. All booths were run by the Fair or by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. “One could throw a pie or dunk a hunk, but you couldn’t buy a cockring,” - <cl citekey="uya"></cl></p>
