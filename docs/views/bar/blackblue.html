<blockquote>"Around 1:30 in the morning they used to take a guy and hang him over the bar by chains and at about ﬁve minutes before two they would undo his jock strap and jerk him off at 2:00, and of course the bar closed at that time. And then they had a back room that you could go and play around in." <cl citekey="walking"></cl>

<blockquote>The Black and Blue was a "heavy" leather bar -- people were serious about their commitment to their performance here, there was no nonbutch behavior, no queeny talk, no overt camping -- and its atmosphere was solemn, even forbidding. It was not a large bar, you entered through an open door and then passed through some leather curtains into a medium-large room, with a full, old-fashioned wooden carved bar, maybe even turn of the century, to your left. The floor of the bar was part wood, part small black and white tiles; it may have been a restaurant in the 1920s and 1930s. The very high ceiling was classic 1930s hammered tin. The far right corner led to a men's room (with urinal troughs; very hot) and next to that was a closed off "back room" for sex. Aside from some framed posters of motorcycle club runs and benefits, the main ornament in the bar was a large Harley that was hung by chains from the ceiling. Suspended high above the crowd.

Music ... would stop, lights in the bar would be dimmed to near complete darkness, and perfectly o cue, stage lighting would illuminate the bike from the corners of the hammered-tin ceiling. It was a stunning sight, and when it happened a magnificent hush fell over the bar. Within moments of the silence falling, the music would being; it was always Gloria from Bash's Mass in B minor. <cl citekey="shame"></cl></blockquote>
