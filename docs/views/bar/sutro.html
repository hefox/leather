<p>Folsom Street Baths - a BDSM gay bathhouse</p>
<p>Renamed The Sutro Baths in 1980, it was featured SF Chronicle on July 7, 1980 <cl citekey="videosutro"></cl>. It closed in 1984 with a two day party "where customers burned safe-sex pamphlets." <cl citekey="bizaroo"></cl></p>
<p>The slogan of the Sutro Baths was "A rainbow of sexual preferences", which was inscribed on a banner above the orgy room, located where the main dance floor of 1015 Folsom now is. </p>
<p>The Sutro Baths also admitted women and transsexuals, even had free admission to women on some nights.</p>
<p>Big Town was "a gay leather shopping mall on the south side of Folsom between 6th and 7th Streets"</p>

<blockquote>Big Town, it was down where the Sutro Baths used to be, on Sixth and Folsom . . . Big Town was a two-story building, three story it might have  been. I haven’t thought of this in years. There was a disco. There was a bar for like a sweater crowd, although I don’t think they were called sweater crowds then. There was a part of the building that was for leather, for the  butch crowd. There was a restaurant upstairs, and I believe there were one or two shops upstairs. . . . There was a shopping center in Los Angeles—I use the term “shopping center” loosely—called Dude City. And Big Town was supposed to be San Francisco’s idea of Dude City.” - Scott Greenville <cl citekey="walking"></cl></blockquote>
