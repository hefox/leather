<p>The Eagle is part of big family/history of unrelated bars throughout the world named some version of the name -- in fact, SF Eagle has been known as SF Eagle, Eagle Tavern, Eagle in Exile. The tradition started in NYC in the 1970s with Eagle's nest</a>. It's historically a bar where leathery gay men gather but in this age, the crowds tend to be more mixed. <cl citekey="eagle"></cl></p>
