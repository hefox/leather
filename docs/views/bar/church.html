<p>There was a Church of St. Priapus in San Francisco in the 70's & 80's. It was on Grove St. in the home of a guy whose name was some thing like Father Broshears. I should be able to remeber his name as I attended "services" once and took a bunch of their literature, which 25 years later I donated to the LGBT Historical Society of Northern California. </p>
<p>I remember the literature had a lot of information about Pagan phallus worship, including accounts of the church castrating members of these cults in medieval Europe. They even had a drawing of the castration instruments they used.</p>
<p>The service I attended found me sitting in a circle with men in their 50's & 60's, I was in my 20's, in the small house of Father 'Bro". </p>
<p>They were very serious about their services and rituals invoking phallic deities, Pan, Cerrunos, & others. I found myself liking the ritual & ceremony, which initially I was afraid would be boring, but bored with the circle jerk at the end which I thought would be the exciting part. </p>
<p>I'm sure that this was because I was so young and wasn't sexually attracted to the older men there. They were very nice guys and I thought their little church was very cool, but I never went back. The Church of St. Priapus received their 501-C3 status in 1983. </p>
<p>In '84 when the baths closed some of the St. Priapus church guys opened up a fabulous secret sex club in a big 2 flat on Clementina St. between 9th & 8th St.'s. This place had guys of all ages, served free beer, had a backyard too, upstairs mazes, glory wholes and above that empty rooms with pillows on the floor, black lites etc. They were open all night too. The place had no fire exit,lots of people smoking cigs & joints, but fortunately no fire ever happened. </p>
<p>They lasted about 10 years on word of mouth, never raising the $5 cover, until the Police finally shut them down. I've lived in SF since 1977 so I thought some of the younger faeires might be interested in this almost forgotten piece of SF gay history.-Jerry the Faerie </p>
