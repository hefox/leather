<p>The Arena bar started the Bare Chest Calendar back in 1984. The calendar was only there for a year as Arena closed down the next. </p>
<p>The Arena manager, Terry Thompson, moved himself and the calendar to the Eagle and turned it into a fundraiser for AIDS fund (according to Mr Marcus -- ):</p>
<blockquote> "The AIDS Fund was established by leather men and the designated beneficiary for most leather title events in San Francisco. Later changed to the AIDS Emergency Fund, it continues to draw much of its support from leather men and women. The Bare Chest Calendar was launched in 1985 at the Arena Bar ostensibly as a "give-away" for customers. When the Arena was sold and manager Terry Thompson moved to manage the SF Eagle, the calendar followed, became a fundraiser for the AEF, and continues to this day at the Powerhouse. I am proud to say I did the contests for 20 years in a row." - <a href="http://www.ebar.com/artscolumns/artcolumn.php?sec=mrm&id=44">Mr Marcus</a></blockquote>

<p>A german disco group of trashy leathermen made <a href="http://overfitti.ng-dis.co/archives/26767">a song</a> about the Arena in the 80s. That website also contains a rather good description/history of the arena:</p>
<blockquote>“The Arena was a San Francisco gay leather bar, established at 399 9th Street and the corner of Harrison, opened in 1978 as a ‘Leather Bar with a Masculine Attitude.” It was a part of the third major wave of leather bar openings which opened in San Francisco between 1978 and 1983, and included the Black and Blue, The Trench, The Cave, Headquarters, The Stables, The Eagle and Chaps. The area around Folsom Street, in San Francisco, at the end of the 70s featured 30 gay leather bars, to get an idea of how this gay subculture was vast.”</blockquote>

<p>“A Walking Tour of South of Market in the 1970s” contains some quotes of people that went there</p>
<blockquote>“It was a relaxed leather and Levi atmosphere, where there wasn’t a lot of posturing and posing and stuff like that. It was just a comfortable environment to go meet guys in.” - Rick Barton, December 17, 1999 </blockquote>
<blockquote>“The Arena was sort of a mix of western and leather. Levis and leather. It attracted a nice crowd. That’s where I met Brian." - Huck Roberts, July 6, 1999</blockquote>
