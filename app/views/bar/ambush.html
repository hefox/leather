<p>The Ambush existed between 1973-1986</p>
<blockquote>"The Ambush is a beer bar and definately for the upper graduate as far as leather bars go" - <a href="http://voices.revealdigital.com/cgi-bin/independentvoices?a=d&d=BFBJFGD19770429.1.14&dliv=none&st=1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN---------------1">Berkley Barb</a></blockquote>

<p>It was a bar and an art gallery.</p>
<blockquote>“An art opening at the Ambush was always exciting. Not only did you get to meet the artist and lots of hot men, there was often a buffet of exotica such as beef tartare, a legacy of Baltic horsemen who ate it raw.” - <a href="http://providence.edgemedianetwork.com/entertainment/culture/143109/barchive:_art_at_the_ambush">via</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>“Like Hamburger Mary’s, the Ambush was funky. It was a cross between a hippie hangout and a leather/western bar. It was a beer-and-wine bar. It was not, however, a wine bar. Wine at the Ambush came from two jugs, red and white. You wanted rose, they’d mix it right there for you. In the afternoon and early evening it was laid-back cool. Joints were shared. The heavy cruising mode wouldn’t kink in until after midnight” - Folsom Street Blues, Jim Stewart</blockquote>
<blockquote>"It also marketed it’s own line of poppers, and has been described as smelling ‘like a strange mixture of battery acid and vegetable shortening’”- San Francisco Bizarro: A Guide to Notorious Sites, Lusty Pursuits, and Downright Freakiness in the City by the Bay by Jack Boulware</blockquote>

<p>This jacket Ambush rewarded to Mr. International Leather, 1982.</p>
<blockquote >"In 1980, John Embry launched the Mr. Drummer contest (note: in the beginning it was just Mr. Drummer) and "appointed" porn legend Val Martin to the title. In 1981, an actual contest was staged and San Francisco's Ray Perea won the title. In 1982, the Drummer contest was staged at the I-Beam on upper Haight Street and Luke Daniel of Los Angeles won the title. He was obliged to compete at IML that year and won again. Luke is the only man to have won both IML and Drummer." - <a href="http://www.ebar.com/artscolumns/artcolumn.php?sec=mrm&id=44">via</a></blockquote>
