After the chorus' practices, the men would proceed to the Cauldron, which was only open for the chorus members. <a href="http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?article=170&sec=news">- via</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Cauldron was open on a Monday only for the Chorus members. Yeah, and they’d play Wagner full blast.
