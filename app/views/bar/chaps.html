<p>Chuck Slaton and Ron Morrison opened the bar after converting it from an auto shop. <cl citekey="dna"></cl></p>

<blockquote ><p>"It was a pretty dark and intense space; jet black paint everywhere, with black leather curtains, chains, and huge screens around the balcony to catch bottles and shot glasses tossed by the boys when things got a little too rough.</p> <p>We've also been told, by someone who was there at the time, that Chaps retained the oil-change pit from the building's tenure as an auto shop. This was a (sometimes-covered) hole in the ground, basically in the middle of the (current) dance floor. A common spectacle was for there to be nude men wrestling down in the pit while the crowd gathered at the edges to jerk off onto them."</p> - <a href="https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/1906-1998.html">Jim English</a></blockquote>

<p>Chaps sent it’s Mr Chaps, Patrick Toner, to IML where he won International Mr. Leather on 1985-05-26 despite lake of feeder Mr SF Leather contest that year. <cl citekey="imlwiki"></cl></p>

<blockquote>"I don’t remember what I did on Memorial Day weekend of 1985, but I do know that San Francisco sent three contestants to Chicago for the International Mr. Leather contest. We had no Mr. San Francisco Leather contest that year, so each of the contestants were sponsored by bars. James Hamrick represented the Detour, a leather bar on Market Street in the Castro neighborhood. The Eagle sent Pete Pettine, and my old fuck-buddy and now good friend Patrick Toner represented Chaps bar on 11th Street." <cl citekey="fbiml"></cl>.</blockquote>

<p>Patrick Toner help started "Up Your Alley" (which started as Ringold alley)</p>

<p>During the first Up your Alley, the Bare Chest Calendar guys (guessing the calendar of 1986) were used in a dunk-a-hunk.</p>

<blockquote >"And they had some hot fuck bartenders – Chuck Slaton is in the middle (cap & arms folded). Chaps was very active in helping to raise a lot of funds for AIDS as it hit San Francisco in the early 80’s. Some of the funds raised went to Ward 5-B at San Francisco General, with sponsorship of fundraisers like “Men Behind Bars”, Christmas tree lightings, Ward 5-B Weekly dinners, and film screenings. Chaps even had a title holder’s in its day – Chaps bartender Patrick Toner won "Mr. International Leather" in 1986." -- <a href="http://www.chapsbarsanfrancisco.com/about.html">Chaps II old website is still up</a> <cl citekey="chapsold"></cl></blockquote>

<p>In 2008, “Chaps II″ opened at the different spot (with different owners) at 1225 Folsom Street, but as of 2013 turned into a less gay Driftwood bar after a brief stint of being another Leather bar called Kok (2011) That spot had been leather bars since 1968 (as Ramrod), then My Place, Cip before turning into Chaps II, Kok, and now Driftwood. </p>
