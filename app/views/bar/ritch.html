<blockquote>Marshall convinced us that we would enjoy ourselves.  We were very much in our honeymoon period but being red blooded gay men meant we enjoyed looking at beautiful men in various stages of undress.  So sue us.  We were not blind.  We decided to go to "Buddy Night" at Ritch Street.  Two for $6.  When we arrived at around 8pm there was a line out the door.  Buddy Night was very popular with couples.   We could get a room and then join in the fun.  One floor was a restaurant and night club.  Adjacent were showers and a large sauna and a steam room.  In another room was a large heated pool.  The lights were low and psychedelic.  One huge room had a huge disco ball in the center and huge pillows covering the floor.  Disco music throbbed throughout the entire complex.  One flight up was the labyrinth.  It was a maze with off angle walls and hidden corners. - <a href="http://jmaguire100.blogspot.com/2012/05/ritch-street-health-club.html">Forty Years Ago (Stories from our life together)</a></blockquote>
