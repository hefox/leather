<blockquote>"They were bar-like. They had bars, and then they always had slings. The Boot Camp was two stories with the back. One, there was a sling, and then in the back there were two or three bathtubs for watersports and then upstairs there were just rooms to have sex. And you know, people were just walking around having sex . ." - <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/257572676/70s-Walking-Tour">Domenic Nunziato</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Boot Camp was in a very nondescript Victorian two-story, probably had been built as a home. It was on Bryant Street, 1010 Bryant, just a block from the police station actually . . . Very nondescript. There was a small sign outside that was sort of a combination of rebus and spelling out. It was a huge Army boot, black Army boot, and the word CAMP in block letters across it. And that was about the way you knew you’d gotten there. There was an empty lot right next to it, where if you were driving you’d park. Always a lot of motorcycles out front" - <a>Tom Drew</a></blockquote>
