<blockquote>"Just across the street is Hamburger Mary’s, a natural food place serving just that until the wee hours of the a.m. " - <a href="http://voices.revealdigital.com/cgi-bin/independentvoices?a=d&d=BFBJFGD19770429.1.14&dliv=none&st=1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN---------------1">Berkley Barb</a></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Hamburger Mary’s originally sat alongside SoMa leather bars like the Hungry Hole, Boot Camp, Folsom Prisoned and The Stud. “The synergy between Hamburger Mary’s and The Stud was that people would come here, maybe have a few beers, go over there, drink and dance all night and then come back here and eat before they went home,” she remembers. “This was before before Uber and people were like, ‘Is anyone going to the Haight? Is anyone going to the Sunset?’ And that’s how we all got home.” </p>
<p>But the place grew into a huge cult favorite. “By about 1978, we started being discovered by society girls who wanted to be a little bit naughty. They would come in with their shopping bags from the Emporium [now the Westfield Center] and City of Paris [now Neiman-Marcus]. They would come in, and one table would be four guys who were totally hung over from the night before having Bloody Marys and lunch in some leather, and then there’s be some guys in business suits and there’d be some fancy ladies from Nob Hill and Pacific Heights. You’d look around, and it was like everyone in San Francisco. It was a complete microcosm. It was a little bit of San Francisco, and they all converged here.”</p>

<p>Hamburger Mary’s clientele weas dying at alarming rate, as was the clientele of all the city’s gay establishments. “I had guys who’d come in and they wanted their last meal to be here,” Rose remembered. “They would come in and they would be completely emaciated and order this big honkin’ burger and take two or three bites.”</p>

<p>“We lost two of our owners. We lost hundreds of people,” Rose said. “That happened all over the city. The whole fabric of the city changed. Until the mid-90s, we were losing people at a regular rate.”
