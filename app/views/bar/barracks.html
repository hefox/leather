<blockquote>"Folsom Street Barracks: 1145 Folsom St. Throughout the 1970s, men in towels lounged on the stairs or retired to group rooms with bunk beds. The entrance was behind the Red Star saloon, where bathers were issued a locker key and towel. It burned down in 1981, and the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence filled vials with the ash and sold them as holy relics called "Ashes From the Barracks" at the Folsom Street Fair." <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Where-History-Was-Made-A-tour-of-41-points-of-2752579.php">via</a></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Back then the bar was called the Red Star Saloon, remembered one of the men in the group, and patrons of the sex club would come down wrapped in towels. There, Rofes recounted how a fire swept through the building, a common occurrence for gay bars, bathhouses, and even churches across the country at that time. Arson caused some, faulty electrical wiring others.</p>

<p>"Gay men were at the forefront of organizing around fire safety," noted Rofes, who credited fire codes being changed due to the gay community's work.</p> - <a href="http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?article=170&sec=news">via</a></blockquote>


<blockquote><p> "The best baths were south of market renovations of rundown blue-collars hotels: seperate rooms with the toilet and shower down the hall. The best if not the first of the early baths was the barracks. On Folsom at Hallam Mews, the barracks was behind and upstairs over the red star saloon. The barracks perfected sporfucking. Everyonewent there, stopping in first at the red star for a twenty-five-cent beer, smoking a joint, kicking back to the sounds of 'It's a Beautiful Da' and Creedence and Janis and the Doors. On buddy night at the barracks, when two were admitted for the price of one, any man out stag made a point to pick up a trick in the Red Star, both sauntering like long-lost fuck buddies out through the door in the back of wall of the Red Star that led to the barracks.</p>

<p>The barracks was barracks was a four-story maz of fantasy sex. In it's long narrow corridors, men stripped down to combat boots and jockstraps. Most carried a white towel over one shoulder and a bottle of poppers tucked in their gray wool socks topped with red and green stripes. They paraded the halls and stairwells bumping into newer and newer flesh arriving in those earl days. They cruised the open doors of the hundred rooms. </p>
<p>..</p>
<p>At the barracks, each room was a fantasy. Men lay back on sheeted bunks, arms across their pecs, teasing their own tits, surrounded by huge latex dildos of monumental cocks and gut-wrenching fists. In four-poster beds made of heavy lumber, men with chinstrap beards and crew cuts hung cradled in black leather slings, their booted feet spread high in stirrups clipped to the suspension chains, sniffing poppers, waiting for the right man proppled by the right drug to shive his fist up their exhibition assholes.</p>
<p>In other rooms, men more top then bottom, straddled chairs under the acid-red glow of the naked light bulbs. They thrilled the hall cruisers with their dark threat of bondage and humiliation and real pain. They projected the right Look; their thights strong in tight black leather chaps, their big chests hairy under tailored leather vests, ropes and chains and metal clamps spread seductively around them, waiting, turning on and turning down most of the hungry, horny men stopping at their door, waiting for the right man to come along to be tied up spread eagled, whipped, tortured, and fucked.  </p>
