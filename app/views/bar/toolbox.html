<p>This image are the infamous mural on from the Toolbox, the first gay leather bar in the South of Market neighborhood in 1962 (closed in 1971).</p>
<p>The bar was notable, being mentioned by Herb Caen in the San Francisco Column in 1964: “As I noted a few days ago, some of the young fellers who hang out in the Tool Box at Fourth and Harrison wear and S or an M on their shirt pockets to indicate Sadist or Masochist. Which prompted a relieved message from Harold Call. "I’m so glad you printed that,” he said. “All this time I thought it meant Single, or Married!" <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foundsf.org%2Findex.php%3Ftitle%3DFolsom_Street%3A_The_Miracle_Mile&amp;t=ZjgxYWM3NTQ0MTQxZmUwZWFlODEwOGVkNWFiZDIyZTU1ZmYzNWUzYyxIU3NDN0JoYQ%3D%3D&amp;m=1&amp;b=t%3AaTyDNLmzS6lfxXsvmdcsww">http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Folsom_Street:_The_Miracle_Mile</a></p>
<p>However it’s main claim to fame was being the main image for Life magazine 1964 article “Homosexuality in America”.</p>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote><p>“<b>HOMOSEXUALITY IN AMERICA</b></p>
<p<i>A secret world grows open and bolder. Society is forced to look at it – and try to understand it<br></i><br>These brawny young men in their leather caps, shirts, jackets and pants are practicing homosexuals, men who turn to other men for affection and satisfaction. They are part of what they call the "gay world,” which is actually a sad and often sordid world. On these pages, LIFE reports on homosexuality in America, on its locale and habits and sums up what science knows and seeks to know about it.<br><br>Homosexuality shears across the spectrum of American life – the professions, the arts, business and labor. It always has. But today, especially in big cities, homosexuals are discarding their furtive ways and openly admitting, even flaunting, their deviation. Homosexuals have their own drinking places, their special assignation streets, even their own organizations. And for every obvious homosexual, there are probably nine nearly impossible to detect. This social disorder, which society tries to suppress, has forced itself into the public eye because it does present a problem – and parents especially are concerned. The myth and misconception with which homosexuality has so long been clothed must be cleared away, not to condone it but to cope with it.”<br><br>..<br><br>“"This is the antifeminine side of homosexuality,“ says Bill Ruquy, part owner of the bar. "We throw out anybody who is too swishy. If one is going to be homosexual, why have anything to do with women of either sex? We don’t go for the giddy kids."Metal is much in evidence in the room: chains on the wall, the collage and bunches of keys hanging from the customers’ leather belts. "That’s part of the sadistic business,” Ruquy explains. “We used to wear chains on our shoulders. Now the keys are in."The effort of these homosexuals to appear manly is obsessive – in the rakish angle of the caps, in the thumbs boldly hooked in belts. Ruquy says, "This is a place for men, a place without all those screaming faggots, fuzzy sweaters and sneakers. Those guys – the ones you see in the other bars – are afraid of us. They’re afraid to come here because everything looks tough. But we’re probably the most genteel bar in town."”<br><br><a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yawningbread.org%2Farch_2000%2Fyax-192.htm&amp;t=YzRjMTQ5ZjlkMGFjYzQwNmZlYzRlNjU3MDFjZGZiZTM1MWQ5NzFkZSxIU3NDN0JoYQ%3D%3D&amp;m=1&amp;b=t%3AaTyDNLmzS6lfxXsvmdcsww">http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2000/yax-192.htm</a> <br><br></p>

<p>The second image is from after the tool box was demolished, but the mural lasted two more years among the ruble. </p>
