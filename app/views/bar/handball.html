<blockquote><p>JACK: Somewhere in the early '80s -- I guess it was '81 -- one of the big, final blasts of this whole sexual abandon was at the Handball Express, down on Harrison, just off of Sixth Street, they had a party -- it was a hospital party -- for sick men.</p>
<p>BILL: Oh, god!</p>
<p>JACK: You could joke about things like that then. You could joke about being sick -- "Oooh! That's so SICK!" You could joke about death. [Pause] It was very youthful. It was very callous. As youth should be! You know, I'm not putting it down, but -- we had to learn a lot of things the hard way. And it's a lot harder than it could have been, or should have been.</p> <a href="http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=The_1980s">"Raw hide: The mystery and power of leather" via foundsf</a>
